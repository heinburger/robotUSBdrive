robotUSBdrive
=============
This is a project for my nephews (they are 3 and 5). Basically, I want a way to teach them about computers and the like, so I purchased a small usb drive and I plan to develop a small web driven app that will let me do some or all of the following:

1. share pictures, audio, video
2. make a facetime/skype call
3. teach about memory/computer/whatever a five year old would understand


Thoughts: This can be done multiple ways, so I am wondering what would be the best - mac does not have an autostart function (and I will be dealing mainly with a mac audience) which is too bad. Windows versions could totally just launch an html file and you can work from there. With the mac version, they will actually have to open the mounted drive and click on the app (html or whatever).

Problems:
- I cannot get the background image to stick
- not sure how to have the app work (I would like a way to have the app check (in the background somewhere) on how recently it was updated/plugged in and possibly have it fetch a new version or something like that...)
